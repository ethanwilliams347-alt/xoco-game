# Toop / Xoco (working title)

A barebones, performant pixel-art destructible physics engine (cellular automata) built from scratch in C++ and SDL2.

## Lore & Premise
Set in a dystopian United States where a Clippy-like AI chat bot took over the government and outlawed humans from participating in the economy. Humans are treated as beasts of burden. Because humans are deemed inefficient and untrustworthy, all intellectual work must be done by AI agents.

To survive, you must use mysterious ancient science to access different worlds. By completing gameplay objectives in these worlds (games like poker, comabt, puzzles), you generate training data for your illegal pet ML agents, allowing them to perform "proof-of-work" tasks on the dark AI economy to earn coins.

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Custom C++ Cellular Automata Engine
- **Rendering:** SDL2 (Hardware accelerated textures)
- **Build System:** CMake

## How to Build

1. Ensure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and a C++ compiler installed (e.g., MSVC via Visual Studio Build Tools).
2. Open a terminal in the root directory.
3. Generate the build files (this will automatically fetch SDL2 via FetchContent):
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -S .
   ```
4. Compile the executable:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build --config Release
   ```
5. Run the game:
   ```bash
   .\build\Release\SlopPhysics.exe
   ```

## Controls
- **Left-Click & Drag:** Spawn elements onto the screen.
- **`1`**: Select **Sand** (Falls down, piles up, slides diagonally).
- **`2`**: Select **Water** (Falls down, spreads out horizontally. Sand is heavier and will sink through it).
- **`3`**: Select **Wall** (Solid, immovable terrain).
- **`4`**: Select **Eraser** (Deletes pixels).
- **`ESC`**: Quit the game.
