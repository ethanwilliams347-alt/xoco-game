// T1's debug tooling.
//
// **The point of this suite is that T1's decisions are not in the SDL event
// switch.** Pause, single-step, the free camera's clamp and the inspector's text
// are all things with a wrong answer - a pause that banks time, a step key that
// runs eight steps, a pan that stops responding at a world edge - and every one
// of them would have been unreachable by any test had it been written where the
// key is bound. What is left in main.cpp is the bindings and the drawing.
//
// The chunk-awake query is here rather than in grid_test because it exists for
// the inspector and its whole contract is the sentence the inspector prints.
