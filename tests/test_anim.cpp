// V3.1's animation selector. Headless because `player_anim` is deliberately
// SDL-free - what it produces is a sheet row and column, and turning that into
// a source rect is main.cpp's job - so the part with the logic in it is
// testable the same way the simulation is.
//
// **What these tests are actually guarding.** The selector's failure modes are
// all silent and all look like art problems rather than logic problems, which
// is why they are worth pinning in code rather than in the manual checklist:
// a cycle that restarts every step reads as "the walk animation is bad", a
// one-shot that never completes reads as "the dig sprite is stuck", and a
// clock that advances per rendered frame reads as "the walk is too fast on my
// machine". None of those would send anyone to this file.
