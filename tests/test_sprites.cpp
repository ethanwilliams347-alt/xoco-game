// The sprite manifest - which BMP each key loads from. The tenth suite.
//
// Same emphasis as the prop list next door: the happy path is two fields off a
// line and is not where this breaks. What is worth pinning is the behaviour
// around a *bad* manifest, because this file sits between "the art I dropped in
// assets/" and "the art on screen", and every way it can fail quietly is a
// session spent wondering why a drawing did not appear.
//
// Two properties in particular are load-bearing and neither is obvious from
// reading the parser:
//
//   - an unlisted key falls back rather than failing, which is what lets the
//     manifest be deleted, truncated or partially written and still leave a
//     runnable game;
//   - a malformed manifest is rejected *wholesale*, not line by line. A
//     half-applied rebinding table is a scene where some art moved and some did
//     not, which is harder to diagnose than the art you already had.
