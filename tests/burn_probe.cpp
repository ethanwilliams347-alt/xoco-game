// What a fire's timing and shape actually are, as numbers.
//
// Session 3 asked for four things in the same breath - slower spread, longer
// consumption, a longer-lived Charred state, and a less linear burn front - and
// three of them are the same complaint said at different volumes. Tuning four
// constants against "still a little too fast" is how session 1 went wrong, so
// this exists to say which of them moved and by how much.
//
// Not an add_test(). These are measurements, not assertions: the right burn
// duration is a matter of taste and a test that pinned it would have to be
// edited every time the taste changed, which makes it a transcription of the
// constants rather than a check on them. What the suite *does* assert about fire
// lives in test_grid.cpp and is about behaviour that must never change - that
// fire spreads at all, that water puts it out.
//
// Three probes, one per complaint:
//
//   spread      - how long a 150-cell plank takes to burn end to end. A9d.
//   consumption - how long a lit body of wood takes to stop existing, and how
//                 much of that time it spends as Charred rather than gone. A9b,
//                 A9c.
//   front       - how ragged the leading edge is, in cells of scatter across the
//                 plank's thickness. A9a, and the only one of the four that is
//                 about shape rather than duration.
