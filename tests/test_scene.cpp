// What `assets/test_material.bmp` currently stamps into an empty world.
//
// **Pinned deliberately, and a failure here is not necessarily a defect.** The
// fixture scene is the world P4's recorded session was played in, so this
// number is that session log's identity: if the fixture changes, the log is
// stale and the replayed benchmark row has to be re-recorded. That is exactly
// the trap P4's entry names - a stale log replays into a world that no longer
// matches and silently measures nothing - and this is the cheapest place to
// catch it, because it fails in `ctest` rather than in a benchmark nobody runs
// on the commit that broke it.
//
// So: if you changed the scene on purpose, update this number **and** re-record
// the session (README, "Recording a session"). If you did not, something has
// changed the legend or the loader underneath you.
// Cross-checked against `tools/pixel_art.py`'s reader, which is an independent
// implementation of the same format: 1,739,099 of the fixture's 2,073,600
// pixels are background, leaving exactly this many that name a material. That
// agreement is what stands behind moving the loader out of `main.cpp` - the
// number is not "what the new code happens to produce".
//
// **Moved from 334,901 on 2026-08-22 by V22 part 2**, which reflowed the
// fixture's regions off the spawn column. The 400-cell drop was attributed
// rather than assumed, by reverting each move as a *group* and re-counting:
// the bridge and its pit are +80, the channel and the sleeper run it starts
// from are -480, the jump ledges are 0, and reverting all three reproduces
// 334,901 exactly. The -480 is three fewer sleepers (20x8 cells each), which
// is what a run starting 40 scene units further east has room for before it
// reaches the world edge.
//
// **The first version of this comment named a different cause and was wrong**,
// and the way it was caught is worth keeping: reverting one line at a time
// looked like a controlled experiment and was not, because reverting the pit
// alone stretched the bridge beam that spans it. A revert has to carry a
// region's dependents or it measures two changes and reports one.
//
// Every region F4.4 named is still present - a count that fell by more than
// this would be an exercise quietly deleted, which is what this pin catches.
