// What `Element::ticks` can actually represent, in numbers.
//
// **This is the instrument for one of the four questions at the instrumentation
// sitting** (ROADMAP_ITEMS.md, item 4, question 4): *what can `Element::ticks`
// actually represent, and does E5a fit in it?* The decision entry says it is
// "settled by prototyping the representation against `cascading` at the sitting,
// not from the desk", and this is the prototype. It ships no feature and asserts
// almost nothing - like `burn_probe` and `water_probe`, what it produces is a
// number to decide against, and the decision is a sentence written into
// ROADMAP_ITEMS.md afterwards.
//
// Not an add_test() for the usual reason plus a sharper one: **every candidate
// below is a representation that does not exist in the engine.** A test asserting
// today's answer would pin a prototype rather than check the product.
//
// Three sections, and they answer three different halves of the question:
//
//   1. **Layout.** What a second byte would actually cost, measured with
//      `sizeof` and `offsetof` rather than counted by hand. `element.h` says the
//      counting version of this has already been wrong once.
//   2. **What the representation has to hold**, which is *two* quantities per
//      axis and not one - a velocity and a sub-cell remainder. The decision entry
//      names only the velocity.
//   3. **Trajectories.** Four candidate representations flown against an
//      `fx` 16.16 reference, which is the arithmetic `Player` already uses and
//      therefore the closest thing to ground truth this project has.
//
// The question section 3 exists to answer is the one the entry calls the
// expensive one: *can a packed integer velocity carry a gravity term at all?*
