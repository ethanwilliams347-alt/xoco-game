// V19/V16 — the wrapping backdrop layer's arithmetic.
//
// This suite links nothing. `src/render/backdrop_wrap.h` is a header of pure
// arithmetic precisely so that the part of a wrapping layer that is easy to get
// wrong can be checked without a window, the same split render/player_anim.cpp
// has with the sprite sheet.
//
// **The two properties at the bottom are the point of the file.** The named
// cases above them are the ones a person would think to write, and every one of
// them passes against an implementation that is wrong at a camera position
// nobody types by hand. The properties sweep positions the game actually reaches
// after a few minutes of walking - hundreds of thousands of pixels from the
// origin, where a float's spacing is no longer 1 - and they are what would catch
// a one-pixel gap at the window edge, which is a defect that gets seen once,
// disbelieved, and never reproduced.
