// itself; the framing checks went with the mechanism they described.

// **V22 (2026-08-18) put a fixed anchor back and the framing check below is
// what states it.** It is not V23 returning: the anchor is a constant, there is
// no easing and no dig trigger, and the two rejected feel reports were about
// the anchor *moving*. The check is written against `Camera::VERTICAL_ANCHOR`
// rather than against 0.80 spelled twice, so retuning the composition is one
// edit; what is pinned here is that the constant reaches the screen at all,
// which is precisely what V23a found it had not.
