//
// Without a way out of it, every move is blocked in every direction and the

// does fit in and take it, preferring straight up. If nothing is open within
// the search radius the body is deeply buried, and it grinds upward one cell a
// step until the search can reach open air.
//
// **A position the body fits in is not on its own a position the body may go
// to** (session 5, D2). The search used to test only the destination, so a body
// buried against a wall was relocated to the nearest open ring cell even when
// that cell was on the far side of the wall -- being poured on was a way
// through terrain. `escape_is_reachable` is the missing half and its comment

// resolve_overlap() exists for. What separates climbing out of a metre of sand
// from stepping through a wall is not whether the path is solid but which way
// the burial goes: grinding up out of sand leaves the body less buried at every
// cell along the way, while crossing a wall means burrowing *into* a mass the
// body was not in before, and only coming out the other side.
//
// So the rule is that being stuck may not get worse on the way out. Walk the
// straight line to the candidate a cell at a time and reject it the moment the
// body is deeper in solid than it was the cell before. A wall the body is flush
// against is a spike in that number at the first step; the sand above it is a
// slope down to zero.
//
// It costs a body-sized scan per cell of path, which is why it is called only
// on candidates the ring has already found to be open, and only on the steps
