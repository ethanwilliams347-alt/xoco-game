// A recorded session: the seed, the world it started in, and one `Input` per
// fixed step.
//
// **This is P4's instrument, and the thing it makes possible is a benchmark row
// that is a played frame by construction rather than by assertion.** Every
// other scenario in `grid_bench` is hand-built, and the plan has twice had to
// argue about which of them counts as realistic - most recently over whether
// `churning` at 211% of a frame is a problem or an artifact. That argument is
// unwinnable from a taxonomy of synthetic scenarios and does not have to be
// had: F2.3 already made a run *a seed plus a replayable list of inputs*, and
// `tests/test_run.cpp` already proves a recorded sequence replays
// byte-identically. This is that list, written to a file.
//
// **One record per fixed step, never per rendered frame.** That is the whole of
// F2.3 and it is why a log recorded on a 165 Hz machine replays identically on
// a 60 Hz one: there is no sampling left in it to diverge. A format that stored
// "the input for a frame" plus a step count would put the frame rate back into
// the simulation through the instrument built to measure it.
//
// **What invalidates a log**, which is the trap that makes this an item rather
// than an afternoon - a stale log replays into a world that no longer matches
// and silently measures nothing:
//
//  - **the fixture scene changes** (`assets/test_material.bmp`), so the world
//    the recording started in is not the world the replay starts in;
//  - **input handling changes** - a new field on `Input`, a re-bound key, a
//    changed brush size step - so the same bytes mean something different;
//  - **the simulation changes**, which is the *interesting* case rather than a
//    failure: an E-track item that alters physics will legitimately replay to a
//    different end state, and the row is still valid. That is why the end-state
//    check below reports rather than refuses.
//
// The first two are caught by the fingerprints and the version; the third
// cannot be distinguished from them automatically, and the replay says so in
// its output rather than pretending to know.
