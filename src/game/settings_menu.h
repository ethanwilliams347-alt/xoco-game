// The settings menu's navigation and selection, as a state machine with no
// window attached.
//
// **SDL-free and header-only, for `debug_view.h`'s reasons.** That file's rule
// is that a decision which only exists inside an SDL event switch is a decision
// no suite can reach (`shell_test` is this one's), and this was the largest
// remaining example of it: fifty
// lines of branching - what a confirm does on a mode that does not fit, what
// happens to the cursor when a switch fails, whether a failed *save* still
// closes the screen - all of it inside `case SDLK_RETURN`.
//
// **What stayed in `main.cpp` is the half a test could not check anyway**: the
// keysyms, and the actual `apply_mode` / `save_display_mode` calls, which need a
// window and a filesystem. This returns an `Outcome` saying what to attempt, and
// the caller reports back through `mode_applied` or `mode_refused`. That
// round-trip is deliberate - it is the only shape in which "try the switch, and
// if it fails say so and change nothing" is expressible without a renderer in
// here.
