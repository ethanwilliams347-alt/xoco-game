// The fixed-step frame pacer: how much simulated time a wall-clock frame buys,
// how many steps that is, and where between two steps the picture falls.
//
// **SDL-free and header-only, for `debug_view.h`'s reasons** - see the note at
// the top of that file, which is the rule this follows rather than a rule this
// invents. Nothing here asks a clock what time it is; `main.cpp` reads
// `SDL_GetPerformanceCounter`, subtracts, and passes the seconds in. That seam
// is `W5`'s: the SDL half gets *told*, not asked.
//
// **Why this is worth extracting at all**, given it is about fifteen lines of
// arithmetic: every one of those lines is a decision with a wrong answer that
// looks fine on screen for a while. A pacer that banks time while frozen lurches
// on resume. A pacer that interpolates a teleport draws the player skating
// through a wall. An alpha that keeps running while paused shows a world that
// never existed. None of those is visible in a screenshot, all three are
// arithmetic, and arithmetic is the cheapest thing in this project to assert.

// callable is what stops the fourth being written from scratch. The mechanism is
// always *not accumulating time* - never skipping the step loop with the
// accumulator still filling, which banks every frozen second and spends it in
// one catch-up burst at the clamp above.
