// V7 - per-cell emissive lighting, at the resolution ROADMAP.md's architecture
// note settled on: a **downsampled** light grid, propagated over a handful of
// iterations, uploaded as a small texture and stretched over the world with
// linear filtering. One extra SDL_RenderCopy, no shader path, no new dependency,
// and a resolution knob (BLOCK) to trade quality against cost.
//
// **This lives in src/render/ and not in src/physics/, and that is the item's
// stated trap rather than a filing preference.** F3.5 settled that rendering
// does not feed the simulation, and gave the reason that matters: two players on
// the same seed and the same input log must not diverge because of what was on
// screen. So the dependency runs one way only - this file includes grid.h, and
// nothing under src/physics/ may ever include this one. Everything here reads
// the grid `const` and writes only its own buffers, which is what makes that
// rule checkable by reading a single `#include` line.
//
// It is deliberately SDL-free so it can be tested headlessly like the
// simulation is, even though it is rendering code. The texture upload is
// main.cpp's job; what this produces is a plain ARGB buffer.

    // Cells per light block on each axis. The knob the architecture note names.
    // Four is small enough that a single flame cell lands in a block of its own
    // rather than being averaged into a wall, and large enough that the
    // propagation below is a rounding error against the physics step - at the
    // padded viewport that is ~216x91 blocks, not 861x361 cells.
    //
    // **Left at 4 when the player was rescaled 2.5x, and that was a decision
    // rather than an oversight.** Raising it to 8 was the obvious way to pay
    // for both the longer reach the bigger body needs and the much larger
    // viewport the widescreen display modes ask for - a quarter as many blocks
    // to solve. It is the wrong trade, for a reason this file already records:
    // occlusion is averaged over a block, so a one-cell wall reads as 1/BLOCK
    // opaque, and B9d ("light penetrating walls", session 3) was exactly that
    // number being too small at BLOCK=4. Doubling BLOCK halves it again and
    // re-opens the defect - a player-drawn one-cell wall would go back to
    // leaking. Reach is bought below instead, where it costs iterations rather
    // than the sharpness of a wall.

    // per block, which light.cpp gives as
    // BLOCK * ln(255*MAX_EMISSION) / -ln(TRANSMIT_CLEAR) - about 83 cells at
    // the current tuning. This bound only has to sit above that, or the
    // iterations become the reach and the tuning stops meaning anything.
    //
    // 24 rather than 16 because that attenuation-limited reach was retuned from
    // 33 cells to 83 with the player rescale: session 3 tuned the look against a
    // screen where the body was 8 cells tall, and the number it settled on is
