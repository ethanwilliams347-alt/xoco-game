// V16's wrapping layers, pulled forward into V19 because V19 cannot afford
// them any other way.
//
// **The size relationship this retires is the reason it exists.** A
// non-wrapping backdrop layer must be as wide as the window plus the whole pan
// range at its own parallax factor - see layer_size() in
// tools/generate_backdrop.py - so **the nearer the band, the bigger its file**.
// The sky is 16 MB at 0.04 and the mountains 20 MB at 0.15; a ground plane sits
// nearer than either, and V19 wants five new bands. Priced flat, that is
// roughly three times the whole of assets/ for art that is, by construction,
// one repeating texture. A wrapping layer has no size relationship to the pan
// range at all: it is one tile, drawn as many times as the window needs.
//
// **This header is arithmetic and nothing else, and that split is deliberate.**
// The draw call that uses it lives in render/frame.cpp and needs SDL; the
// question of *where the copies go* does not, so it is here, where a headless
// suite can reach it. Same arrangement render/player_anim.cpp has with the
// sprite sheet, and for the same reason: the part that is easy to get wrong is
// the part that does not need a window to check.
//
// Nothing in src/physics/ may include this. It is renderer-side by the same
// rule the light field is - see the ENGINE_SOURCES / RENDER_SOURCES split in
// CMakeLists.txt, which is what makes that a build error rather than a habit.

//
// **A receding *surface* has no single depth, so it has no single parallax
// factor** - the same sentence the plane construction below opens with, and it
// is true of a painted surface as much as of a generated one. What differs is
// what may be done about it. A generated plane is a repeating noise tile with no
// feature wide enough to shear, so it can ramp its factor smoothly, one strip
// per row-range. **Painted art has features, so its factor has to change where
// the art does not** - across a run of rows that is uniform in colour, where a
// discontinuity in scroll offset has nothing to reveal.
//
// `row0`/`row1` are rows of the layer's texture, half-open, top-down. Vertical
// is always 1:1: the perspective is already in the paint, and V28b locked the
// authored stack's vertical factor at 1.00 so the composition is the painting at
// every camera height.
//
// **Here rather than in frame.h because it is arithmetic about art and knows no
// SDL**, which is what lets `boot_test` check a band table against the BMP it
// describes. The same split `wrap_axis` below already has with the draw call.

// window's edge, never after it, so there is no uncovered strip on that side.

// One axis of it. `origin` is the layer's unwrapped parallax origin - what
// Camera::parallax_origin_x/y returns, which runs negative as the camera moves
// forward and is unbounded in both directions over a long session.
//
// **The whole job is turning that unbounded number into a bounded one**, and
// doing it without ever letting the visible result depend on how far the camera
// has travelled. std::fmod keeps the sign of its left operand, so a negative
// origin gives a result in (-tile, 0] directly and a positive one needs a
// single subtraction to land in the same half-open interval. Both branches must
// produce a `first` that is <= 0, because a `first` of exactly +0.001 leaves a
// one-pixel column of whatever was behind the layer showing at the window edge,
// on one frame, at one camera position - the class of defect that gets seen
// once, disbelieved, and not reproduced.
//
// The interval is half-open at 0 and not at -tile on purpose: `first == 0` is a
// legitimate aligned state and must not be pushed to -tile, which would draw an
// entire redundant copy off-screen on every frame the layer happens to align.

// --- V19's ground plane: one band drawn as N strips ------------------------
//
// **A receding plane has no single depth, so it has no single parallax
// factor.** Drawn flat at one factor it reads as a wall standing behind the
// world rather than as ground going away, which is the failure this whole
// construction exists to avoid - and it is the one piece of new rendering V19
// costs. The plane is cut into horizontal strips, each strip is a depth, and
// each strip therefore scrolls at its own rate and samples its own rows of the
// tile.
//
// **The relation, and it is one relation rather than two.** For a plane seen
// edge-on, screen distance below the horizon goes as inverse world distance, so
// the scroll factor is linear in that distance:
//
//     f(t) = f_far + (f_near - f_far) * t,   t = 0 at the horizon, 1 at the near edge
//
// and world distance is d(t) = 1/f(t). The texture is laid out *in world
// distance* - its top row is the far edge and its bottom row the near one - so
// the source row for a strip falls out of the same d(t) with no second curve to
// author and nothing to keep in step:
//
//     v(t) = (d(t) - d_near) / (d_far - d_near),  src_y = (1 - v) * tile_h
//
// **This is the "texture gradient" mechanism and it comes out of the geometry
// rather than out of the art.** Marks near the viewer are magnified and marks
// near the horizon are compressed, because a far strip spans a huge range of
// world distance in a handful of screen rows. A correction to ROADMAP.md's V19
// entry belongs here rather than only there: that entry says "source row height
// shrinking with distance", and the relation above does the opposite - `src_h`
// *grows* with distance. The mechanism the entry names in the same sentence
// (the reference's marks widening 1.3x-3.0x toward the viewer) is what is built,
// and it is the sentence that was wrong, not the mechanism.
//
// **Only the vertical is scaled, and the horizontal tile width is constant
// across every strip.** A true plane shrinks a mark in both axes, so this is a
// stated cheapness rather than an oversight. Scaling the tile's width per strip
// costs nothing arithmetically and looks worse: adjacent strips would then tile
// at different widths, their phases would diverge, and the mark pattern would
// stair-step at every strip boundary - twenty-four visible seams bought to fix a
// foreshortening nobody can see on a night-dark texture. The vertical
// compression alone carries the gradient.
struct Plane {
    float horizon_y;    // screen y of the far edge
    float bottom_y;     // screen y of the near edge - normally the window's bottom
    float far_factor;   // parallax at the horizon
    float near_factor;  // parallax at the near edge
    int tile_h;         // the tile's height in pixels; its rows are the plane's depth
};

// How many screen pixels one row of the tile occupies, and therefore how deep
// the plane is. **The plane's whole geometry is this one number plus wherever
// the horizon landed** (V24, 2026-08-18).
//
// **This is what replaces `bottom_y = window_h`, and the window is deliberately
// not a parameter of this function any more.** Playtest session 10: *"the
// entire .bmp stays on screen and squishes as the sprite flies up. this does
// not make sense."* It was right, and the cause was that the near edge was the
// bottom of the window - a constant - while the far edge was parallaxed at the
// mountains' 0.06. So the near end of the plane had an effective vertical
// parallax of **zero** and the far end did not: the nearer end of one layer
// less parallaxed than its further end, which is the one thing a parallax stack
// may never do. The tile never left the frame at any camera height and was
// squeezed 30% across the climb, 2.54 px per texel down to 1.79.
//
// **The plane now translates and clips, the way every other layer does**, and
// that was a decision between two fixes rather than the only one available. The
// other was to give the near edge its own vertical factor (~0.21, off the
// generator's ~0.4x ladder) and let the band *grow* as the camera climbs, which
// is honest perspective for a surface seen from higher up - and which magnifies
// the tile's marks about 75% over the world's height. A constant scale was
// chosen: the report's complaint is that the layer resizes, and the depth-honest
// fix resizes it too, just for a better reason. The argument is in ROADMAP.md
// under V24; do not re-derive the second option from this constant.
//
// **2.5 is the shipped composition, kept rather than re-chosen.** The band at
// the spawn was 651.4 px over a 256-row tile, so 2.544 px per texel; 2.5 gives
// 640 and moves the plane's near edge by 11 px at the one camera position that
// had it exactly at the window's bottom. **Stated per texel and not as a
// fraction of the window** because that is what makes it constant across the
// three DISPLAY_MODES - a fraction of the window would put the same tile on
// screen at two sizes at 1080 and 1440, which is the reported defect again with
// the window standing in for the camera.

// which is the point: **a layer's geometry is a fact about the layer, and the
// window only decides how much of it you can see.**
