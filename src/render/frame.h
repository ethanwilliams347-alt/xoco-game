// The world layers of one frame, in the order they are drawn - V17's half of
// the V11 block, and at this commit it is *only* a move. Every line in
// frame.cpp came out of main.cpp unchanged, comments included, and the golden
// frame test exists to say so in a number rather than in this sentence.
//
// **UI is not here and does not become here.** The reticle, the HUD, the
// hotbar, the run-over wash and the settings menu live in render/overlay.cpp
// **and are drawn by a separate call after this one returns** - they were in
// main.cpp until W5 part 3 on 2026-08-18, and this sentence said so; moving
// them changed which file they sit in and nothing about the rule. The boundary
// is the one V7 already drew when it put the light pass before them:
// everything in this file is *in the world* and gets lit, everything after it
// is not and must not be. A reticle that goes orange near a flame is defect B1,
// and moving UI in here is how it comes back.
//
// The layer list itself - naming the layers as data rather than as a run of
// draw calls, and adding the mid-ground band the reference frames spend most of
// their depth on - is V11 and the next commit. This one exists so that commit
// has something to prove itself against.

// A non-simulated sprite anchored to a world position - V4's props layer.
// Exercises no system and is never dug, ignited or displaced; see notes/
// art_direction.txt for why trees specifically are drawn *before* the cell
// texture rather than after; it is that ordering, not anything in this
// struct, that gives a planted trunk its occlusion for free.

    SDL_Texture* texture;
    int w, h;         // native size, in world cells (1 BMP pixel = 1 cell)

    float anchor_y;
};

// V8's two static parallax layers.
//
// **There were briefly three.** V11 added a mid-ground band between the
// mountains and the world on 2026-08-16 and removed it the same day, when the
// played-frame check that notes/reference_observations.txt entry 4 asked for
// came back saying our own terrain already occupies that band. The argument and
// the reopen trigger are at the layer table in frame.cpp, which is where someone
// adding one would look.
//
// **The factors are no longer here.** They live in the generated
// render/backdrop_layers.h, written by `python tools/generate_backdrop.py
// --header` from the same table that sizes the images - which retires V11's
// fourth bullet, the duplication between this side and the tool with nothing
// enforcing agreement and a seam at the pan limit as the failure. The comment
// this replaces described that duplication accurately and asked a reader to
// grep before changing a number, which is documentation standing in for
// enforcement; there is now one copy.
//
// **The factors themselves are still eyeballed and still unmeasured**, and
// V11 shipped them byte for byte unchanged on purpose: the one source that
// could have measured them cannot, because the CnC reference frames are three
// separately generated scenes rather than one camera pan (notes/
// reference_observations.txt entry 1). A retune during the restructure would
// have left the golden checksum unable to say which of the two moved it.
// **`ground` is the first layer here that is a *tile* rather than an image**
// (V19). The other two are as wide as the window plus the whole pan range at
// their own factor, which is why the nearer one is the larger file; the plane
// sits nearer than either and would have been over 30 MB priced that way. It
// wraps instead - `ground_w`/`ground_h` are a tile size, and how many copies
// the window needs is asked of backdrop_wrap::wrap_axis every frame.
//
// Its height is not a height. The tile's rows are the plane's *depth*, sampled
// top to bottom exactly once across the band, which is what lets one texture
// carry both the value ramp and the mark gradient.

// A multiply. 255 is "unchanged", 128 is "half", 0 is "black" - V11's fourth
// bullet, the half of it that the light pass could never do.
//
// **The light pass only ever adds, and that is the whole defect.** V7 lights hot
// things by compositing one full-screen texture with SDL_BLENDMODE_ADD, so every
// biome, every depth band and every time of day is at least as bright as the art
// was authored, and nothing on screen can be made darker than the pixel that was
// drawn. Night, underground, fog and aerial perspective are all the same missing
// operation, and it is this one.

    // thing that does move the checksum at this step is the per-layer grade on
    // the mountains, which is a single number in the table in frame.cpp.
    //

// rather than a comment because every item after V11 adds a layer that has to
// declare where it belongs.
//
// **This says only what the composition can currently enforce, which is an
// ordering**, and the static_asserts in frame.cpp hold the table to it, so a
// layer whose declared position disagrees with where it actually sits fails the
// build rather than shipping a comment that has gone false.
//
// **`Grade` is new at step 3 and it is what makes `Lit` mean more than
// "earlier".** The grade quad multiplies everything drawn so far and the light
// pass then adds on top of the result, which is the whole reason they are two
// entries and in that order: a fire at night must not be dimmed by the night.
// Reverse them and the only light source in the frame gets graded down with the
// rock it is sitting on.
//
// **What it still does not claim.** V11's text wants V16's animated bands to sit
// *behind* the world and not pick up firelight from in front of it. The grade
// does not buy that - it is a multiply over everything already drawn, not a
// per-layer exemption from the additive pass - and expressing it needs a render
// target. The per-layer `Grade` on a `Layer` is the piece that *is* per-layer,
// and it is a separate field for exactly that reason: one of these two is a
// property of a layer and the other is a property of the frame, and collapsing
// them is how a value that means two things gets tuned for one of them.
