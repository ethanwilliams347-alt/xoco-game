// **This was the `fixture` scene until 2026-08-24 and is now `empty`.** The
// owner retired every scene built before `empty`, and this function was the
// last place the fixture was still load-bearing rather than merely referenced:
// `main.cpp` falls back to it when `assets/scenes.txt` is missing or malformed,
// so for as long as it named the fixture it was **the guarantee the game boots
// at all**, quietly depending on three asset files that are no longer shipped
// as the scene. A fallback that can fail to load is not a fallback.
//
// **`empty` is the right fallback for the reason it is a legitimate scene at
// all** (see the header): a scene that names no files cannot fail to find one.
// The body lands on the world's bottom border and the player is in a real, if
// featureless, world. **That is not `Spawn::Floor` being used as a recovery
// path** - the refusal beside that enumerator forbids exactly that - because
// this scene is *meant* to be empty rather than having failed a terrain scan.
//
// **The cost is stated rather than hidden: the fallback world now has no
// terrain in it.** A missing scene list used to boot into something diggable
// and now boots into open air. That is the honest reading of a missing file,
// and it is preferable to the alternative on offer, which was booting into a
// scene whose assets may not exist.
