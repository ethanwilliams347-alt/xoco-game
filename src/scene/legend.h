// The colours a *material map* uses to name an ElementType, and nothing else.
//
// **These are authoring metadata, not the palette anything is drawn in**, and
// keeping the two apart is the whole reason this table exists. The scene loader
// used to resolve a material-map pixel by matching it against `MATERIALS[i].color`
// - the colour the material is *rendered* in - which quietly made every scene
// file a hostage of the art direction. V2 retuned the palette, and every pixel
// of `assets/test_material.bmp` stopped matching anything on the same commit:
// the whole authored scene silently loaded as Empty, because an unmatched pixel
// and a genuinely empty pixel were the same answer. The game booted to a blank
// world and nothing failed.
//
// So: a legend colour is an arbitrary marker with no visual meaning, and the
// values below are **frozen**. Changing one invalidates every material map ever
// authored, exactly the way changing a `sim_random::Stream` tag invalidates
// every world its seed ever produced - and for the same reason it is written
// down here rather than remembered. The palette in `MATERIALS` is now free to
// change as often as the art needs it to, which is what V6 is going to do.
//
// The five in use are the ones already authored into the existing scene, chosen
// so the fix costs no repaint. The other three are picked to be obviously
// artificial - nobody paints terrain in pure magenta by accident.
