"""Builds the sheet named by player_sheet.SHEET_PATH from authored frame BMPs, stamping each one
into the slots tools/player_sheet.py's ANIMATIONS table declares.

This is what replaces hand-pasting once there is real art: the sheet stops
being the thing you edit and becomes a *derived* file, rebuilt from the frames
in assets/. That distinction is the point of the tool rather than a side
effect - a sheet edited in place has no source, so a frame that lands in the
wrong column or an animation that half-updates (the flashing case: one slot
redrawn, its siblings left on the old pose) is invisible until it is on
screen. Rebuilding from frames makes both states impossible to reach.

    # one frame stamped into every declared slot
    python tools/build_player_sheet.py assets/copy_candidate_a.bmp

    # a base everywhere, with specific slots overridden as they get drawn
    python tools/build_player_sheet.py assets/copy_candidate_a.bmp \
        --frame walk:0=assets/walk_0.bmp --frame walk:1=assets/walk_1.bmp

**Frames are bottom-aligned into the frame box, and that is a correctness
fix rather than a convenience.** src/render/player_sprite.h anchors the sprite
to its collision box's bottom-centre, so the frame's last row *is* the ground
line - art that stops one row short renders a figure hovering above every
floor it stands on, forever, which reads as a physics bug rather than an art
one (tools/player_sheet.py's --validate calls out exactly this). Authored art
does not reliably fill its own last row, so the alignment happens here, at
build time, instead of being a rule every drawing has to remember. Content
taller than FRAME_H is an error, not a crop: silently cutting a head off is
worse than refusing.

Horizontal placement is left exactly as authored. A sprite wider than the
8-cell collision box is correct by design - notes/art_direction.txt is
explicit that sleeves hanging outside the box are art, not body - so there is
no centring rule that could be applied without overriding a deliberate choice.

Off-palette colour is reported, not rejected. Conforming to the locked set
(tools/snap_to_palette.py, then tools/validate_palette.py) is a separate,
later step, and a build step that refused work-in-progress art would just
mean the sheet stopped being rebuildable exactly when it is changing most.
