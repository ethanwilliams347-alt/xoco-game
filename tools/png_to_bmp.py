"""Converts a PNG back into this project's BMP format (24-bit uncompressed,
COLOR_KEY-transparent - see tools/pixel_art.py's BMP codec comment) after a
round trip through an external sprite editor.

The reason this exists rather than saving straight back to .bmp from the
editor: LibreSprite (like Aseprite, the project it's forked from) exports BMP
as 32-bit for an RGB-mode sprite, not the 24-bit format tools/pixel_art.py's
read_bmp requires - so a file saved directly as .bmp from the editor can fail
tools/validate_palette.py or tools/player_sheet.py --validate for a format
reason that has nothing to do with the art. Exporting PNG from the editor and
converting here sidesteps that: this project already writes PNG for output
(tools/bmp_to_png.py) and reads it for the Gemini pipeline
(tools/gemini_to_player_frame.py, which this reuses), so PNG is the one
format both ends already handle correctly.

Alpha, if the PNG has it, decides transparency directly (below 128 becomes
COLOR_KEY) - unlike gemini_to_player_frame.py's flood-fill, which exists only
because a fresh Gemini render doesn't reliably carry a real alpha channel. A
properly erased sprite-editor export does, so use it instead of re-guessing
the background from colour.
