"""Points a sprite key at a BMP you dropped into assets/, from the command line.

The workflow this exists for: drag a .bmp into assets/ in File Explorer, run one
command, launch the game and see it. Before this, both halves of that were code
changes - the path was a string literal in main.cpp, and assets/ is copied next
to the exe at build time, so even editing the existing file in place did nothing
until a rebuild. This writes the binding and stages the file, so neither is true
any more.

    python tools/load_sprite.py --list                        # what is bound to what
    python tools/load_sprite.py player_sheet my_sheet.bmp     # rebind and stage
    python tools/load_sprite.py --stage                       # re-copy assets to the build dirs

The file argument is a name inside assets/, because assets/ is the only place
the game looks - `my_sheet.bmp` and `assets/my_sheet.bmp` both work, a path
anywhere else is refused with the reason.

**What this does not do is change what a sheet's frames mean.** Frame size, row
order and frame counts are the ANIMATIONS table in tools/player_sheet.py and the
header it generates; they are facts about the game, not about the image. So a
sheet whose grid disagrees with the table is rejected here, with the two numbers
printed, rather than bound and left to draw sliced. Change the table and rerun
--header if the new sheet really is a different shape.
